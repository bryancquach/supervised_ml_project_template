# Results directory overview

The subdirectories within `results/` are divided by stage of analysis. Each stage will include a subdirectory ID that denotes a particular type of munging or analysis (e.g., RNA-seq sample QC or differential gene expression analysis) using a sequential numbering system. Each munging or analysis type will have its own subdirectory with a sequential numbering system for specific instances of that type.
